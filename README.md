# SegPC submission

The submission consists of two parts:
- Deep learning models. Two semantic segmentation models using the DeepLab and HRNet-Seg architectures, and an instance segmentation model using the Mask RCNN architecture were trained. The notebooks to prepare the data, train the models, and use them for inference is available at the [notebooks folder](notebooks). The models can be downloaded from the following [link](https://unirioja-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/joheras_unirioja_es/EkiF6QjyizhIkp4_hTBfSOEBAqYmOBAG_ynp_maKrP0qFA?e=AQvo7u).
- An ImageJ plugin. An ImageJ plugin was implemented to postprocess the images. The code for the plugin is available in the [plugin folder](plugin). The plugin can be downloaded from the following [link](https://github.com/joheras/SegPC_submission/releases/tag/plugin).
